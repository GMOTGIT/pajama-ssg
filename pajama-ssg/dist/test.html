    <p>
      It was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, to look
      in upon us of an evening, and his visits were welcome to Sherlock Holmes,
      for they enabled him to keep in touch with all that was going on at the
      police headquarters. In return for the news which Lestrade would bring,
      Holmes was always ready to listen with attention to the details of any
      case upon which the detective was engaged, and was able occasionally,
      without any active interference, to give some hint or suggestion drawn
      from his own vast knowledge and experience.
